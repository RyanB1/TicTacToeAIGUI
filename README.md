# TicTacToeAI GUI Version

This is the GUI version of my TicTacToeAI repo that used a CLI to play the game. That can be found [here](https://github.com/RyanB1/TicTacToeAI).

This GUI was made in C++ using the [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) cross-platform GUI library.

I'll be adding a link to where you can download the game and I will also add screenshots of the interface to this readme soon.
